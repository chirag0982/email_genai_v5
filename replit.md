# Project Overview

## Overview

This is a simple Python "Hello, World!" program that demonstrates basic Python script execution. The program serves as a minimal example of Python syntax and console output functionality.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Single Script Architecture**: The application consists of a single Python file (`hello.py`) that executes a basic print statement
- **Console-Based Output**: Uses Python's built-in `print()` function to display text to the standard output
- **Script Execution Model**: Designed to run as a standalone Python script using the shebang line for direct execution

### Design Patterns
- **Procedural Programming**: Uses a simple procedural approach with direct function calls
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Relies only on Python's built-in functionality with no external libraries

### Runtime Environment
- **Python 3 Compatible**: Uses Python 3 shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) for cross-platform execution
- **Standard Library Only**: No additional imports or dependencies required

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Python 3**: Requires Python 3 interpreter for execution
- **Operating System**: Compatible with any OS that supports Python 3 (Linux, macOS, Windows)

### Development Dependencies
- None required - can be run with basic Python installation

### Third-Party Services
- None - this is a standalone application with no external service integrations
